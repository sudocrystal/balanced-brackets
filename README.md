# balanced-brackets problem
**Given a String of brackets, how might we determine if the brackets are balanced or not?**

So, for example:
- `[][]` is a string of balanced brackets, but `[][[` is not
- `[]` is a string of balanced brackets, but `][` is not 
- `[[[][]][]]` is a string of balanced brackets, but `[[[]][]][]]` is not
